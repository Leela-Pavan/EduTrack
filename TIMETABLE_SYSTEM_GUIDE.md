## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask application
- SQLite database
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### 2. System Integration
The timetable system is fully integrated into your EduTrack application:

```python
# Already integrated in app.py:
from timetable_routes import timetable_bp
app.register_blueprint(timetable_bp)
```

### 3. Access Points
- **Management Interface**: `/admin/timetable/management`
- **Interactive Dashboard**: `/admin/timetable/dashboard`
- **API Base**: `/timetable/api/`

### 4. Initial Setup
1. Start the application: `python app.py`
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard
3. Click "Manage System" under "Automated Timetable System"
4. Add teachers, subjects, classrooms, and student groups
5. Click "Generate Timetable" to create your first schedule

## 🎮 User Guide

### Admin Management Interface
1. **Teacher Management**:
   - Add teachers with subject qualifications
   - Set weekly unavailability patterns
   - Configure maximum hours per week

2. **Subject Configuration**:
   - Define weekly hours (lecture/lab/tutorial)
   - Set special room requirements
   - Configure minimum room capacity

3. **Classroom Setup**:
   - Add rooms with capacity and facilities
   - Mark rooms as active/inactive
   - Organize by building and floor

4. **Student Group Organization**:
   - Create groups with student counts
   - Assign to academic year and semester
   - Optionally assign coordinator teachers

### Interactive Dashboard

   - Conflict resolution history

## ⚙️ Algorithm Details

### Constraint Types
1. **Teacher Availability**: Respects unavailability patterns and hour limits
2. **Room Capacity**: Ensures student group fits in assigned classroom
3. **Special Requirements**: Matches subjects to required room types
4. **Time Conflicts**: Prevents double-booking of teachers/rooms
5. **Academic Rules**: Enforces scheduling best practices

### Generation Process
1. **Data Validation**: Verify all constraints are satisfiable
2. **Domain Reduction**: Eliminate impossible assignments
3. **Backtracking Search**: Systematic exploration with heuristics
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic retry with relaxed constraints
5. **Optimization**: Minimize conflicts and maximize efficiency

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Constraints
Extend `timetable_generator.py`:

```python
class CustomConstraint(Constraint):
    def is_satisfied(self, teacher_id, subject_id, group_id, classroom_id, time_slot_id):
        # Your constraint logic here
        return True
```

### UI Modifications
Update templates and JavaScript files:
- `timetable_management.html` - Management interface
- `timetable_dashboard.html` - Interactive dashboard
- `timetable-management.js` - Management logic
- `timetable-dashboard.js` - Dashboard interactions

### Database Extensions
Modify `timetable_schema.py` to add new fields or tables:

```python
def extend_schema():
    cursor.execute('''
        ALTER TABLE timetable_teachers 
        ADD COLUMN new_field TEXT
    ''')
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Generation Fails**: Check constraint compatibility and data consistency
2. **Conflicts Persist**: Review teacher availability and room capacity
3. **UI Not Loading**: Verify JavaScript dependencies and API connectivity
4. **Database Errors**: Ensure all foreign key relationships are valid

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Performance Optimization
- Reduce constraint complexity for faster generation
- Limit backtracking depth for large datasets
- Use database indexing for frequently queried fields

## 📊 System Statistics
