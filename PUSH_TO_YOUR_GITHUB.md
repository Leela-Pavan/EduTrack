# Commands to Push to Your GitHub Repository

## After creating repository on GitHub, run these commands:

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your committed changes
git push -u origin main

# If the main branch is called 'master' instead of 'main', use:
# git push -u origin master

## Alternative: If you get an error about main branch, try:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## Your GitHub repository URL will be:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME

## Share this URL with your friends and they can:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
2. Or download as ZIP file from GitHub
3. Or you can add them as collaborators for push access
