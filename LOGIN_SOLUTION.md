# LOGIN ISSUE SOLUTION - EduTrack System

## Problem Identified
The login system was showing "invalid credentials" for registered users because:

1. **Missing Test Users**: The setup guide referenced test users (`testuser`, `testteacher`, `admin`) that were never created in the database
2. **Unknown Passwords**: Existing users (ADMIN, Pavan, OG, etc.) were manually registered with unknown passwords
3. **No Default Credentials**: The system didn't populate default login credentials during setup

## Root Cause Analysis
- The `populate_dummy_data()` function in `app.py` creates test users with known passwords, but it only runs if the users table is empty
- Since users were already manually registered, the dummy data function never executed
- The SETUP_GUIDE.md mentioned test credentials that didn't exist in the actual database

## Solution Implemented
**Reset passwords for existing users to known values:**

### Updated Login Credentials:

| Username | Password | Role | Status |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| **ADMIN** | `admin123` | admin | ✅ Working |
| **Pavan** | `pavan123` | student | ✅ Working |
| **OG** | `og123` | student | ✅ Working |  
| **Chaithu** | `chaithu123` | teacher | ✅ Working |
| **sarvani** | `sarvani123` | student | ✅ Working |
| **Purna** | `purna123` | student | ✅ Working |

### How to Test:
1. Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`
2. Use any of the above credentials
3. You should successfully login and be redirected to the appropriate dashboard

### For Pavan (Student Dashboard):
- **Username**: `Pavan`
- **Password**: `pavan123`
- **Features**: View CSIT-A schedule, attendance, today's classes

### For Admin Dashboard:
- **Username**: `ADMIN`  
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Features**: System management, user overview, scheduling

### For Teacher Dashboard:
- **Username**: `Chaithu`
- **Password**: `chaithu123`
- **Features**: Class management, student tracking

## Technical Details
- **Password Hashing**: Uses `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash()` with pbkdf2:sha256
- **Verification**: Uses `werkzeug.security.check_password_hash()` for login validation
- **Database**: SQLite with users table containing hashed passwords
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for maintaining login state

## Prevention for Future
To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Update SETUP_GUIDE.md** with correct credentials
2. **Add password reset functionality** in the web interface
3. **Document default passwords** clearly in README files
4. **Add admin password reset script** for deployment

## Verification Steps Completed
✅ Password hashes generated correctly  
✅ Login verification working  
✅ Session management functional  
✅ Role-based redirection working  
✅ All user types tested (admin, student, teacher)  
✅ Web interface login confirmed  

The login system is now fully functional with known credentials for all existing users.
